<p><b>TL;DR:</b> Enjoys socializing, ice skating, dragonboating and long nights programming (pro-gaming). Always willing to learn and implement new ideas and always looking for a better way.</p>

<p>I'm currently a student at Cornell University, studying computer science in the College of Engineering. I am minoring in electrical computer engineering and business.</p>
<p>I am passionate about working with technology, always looking for ways to improve life with technology or to develop new technology to do so. It so happens that a very effective way to realize these goals is in the software engineering industry, where the efforts of one person can be multiplied many thousandfolds. I love technology with impact, and the more people I can reach to make that impact, the more I feel like I am fufilling my goals.</p>
